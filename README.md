### Background/Objective:
To practice aquiring, cleaning, formatting, augmenting, analyzing, and visualizing data, from various sources, for business intelligence and/or machine learning model development.  For this example, the topic of 'Alcohol' was filtered within the CDC Chronic Disease Data, but feel free to explore and review other topics within the CDC dataset. The following data sources where leverage.

Some potential next steps:
1. Combine data in R and/or Tableau to investigate any relationships, trends, and/or insights.
1. Are there any interesting trends? Correlations?
1. Based on your observations are there any additional data elements that could potentially enhance the analysis?
1. Group round-table discussion? What could be do differently? what could we do better? How do we want to proceed?
